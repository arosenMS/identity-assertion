# Scope

This document outlines the scope of work undertaken by the Creator Assertions Working Group’s Identity Assertion project.

## Objectives

The objective of this project is to document a new identity assertion specification.

The identity assertion should allow an actor (typically an individual human or an organization of humans) to document their relationship to a C2PA asset produced by them or on their behalf independently from the C2PA claim generator, and to allow consumers of a C2PA asset to independently verify that the received asset was in fact produced by the named actor and has not been tampered with.

This is to be viewed as an additional trust signal over and above the trust signals defined in the core C2PA Technical Specification.

It is a non-goal of this Working Group to alter the core C2PA Technical Specification in any way or to replace the trust signals provided therein.

## Deliverables

This Working Group shall produce a version 1.0 of an identity assertion specification which shall reflect the consensus of the members at that time. The Working Group may produce subsequent versions of the specification.

## Meeting schedule and notes

See [CAWG: Meeting schedule](https://creator-assertions.github.io/#_meeting_schedule) for meeting schedule and notes from previous meetings.

## Dependencies

The identity assertion specification must align with the C2PA Technical Specification that is current as of the time of publication. The specification may also describe compatibility with previous versions of the C2PA Technical Specification.
